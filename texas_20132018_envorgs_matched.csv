See Part III, Line 4b.##OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 4: YWE: WEN's signature program, Young Women Energized, introduces high school girls to the energy industry and holds an annual event for them to engage with professional women and learn about various careers in the industry. This program was started in 2004. OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 5: Charity Event: Members of Women's Energy Network are actively involved in the community all across Houston. Women's Energy Network is pleased to sponsor chosen charities and bring its members information on volunteer opportunities in local organizations. Since 2000, Women's Energy Network has supported and raised money through charity events for organizations such as Women Helping Women, Girls, Inc, the Houston Area Women's Center, Boys and Girls Country, and Community Family Center.Mentoring: WEN instituted a Mentoring Program in 2007. This provides an opportunity for WEN members to enrich their careers by expanding their networks, growing their knowledge and diversifying their experience. WEN members who wish to be mentored will identify specific learning goals and will be matched in mentoring circles with WEN mentors who best meet their learning goals and who will work with them to achieve those goals over the scheduled term.","A global organization that educates, attracts, retains, and develops professional women working across the energy value chain. WEN develops programs to provide networking opportunities and foster career and leadership development of women who work in the energy industry.","Membership: The Women's Energy Network of Houston was founded in 1994 with the purpose of fostering the development and advancement of women in energy by developing a strong network. After years of being the sole woman involved in energy transactions, Women's Energy Network's founder believed that many women energy professionals were in the same position, but unable to connect with each other. Years later, the Women's Energy Network remains committed to providing high caliber events and networking to its diverse membership from across the energy value chain. WEN Houston also sponsors new chapters and retains some of the membership fees for support.##In 2013, WEN held the first Womens Energy Network Conference. The Conference will be held biannually. This is a national event that runs over 2 days. In 2013, the Conference had approximately 245 attendees (members and non-members). The Conference featured 4 separate tracks with educational sessions and more than 50 speakers. As with other WEN events there were technical sessions and professional development sessions. The Conference afforded the attendees valuable career networking opportunities.##Education and Networking - Luncheons, special events, webinars: Each month Women's Energy Network hosts luncheons for 80-150 members and guests featuring exceptional leaders in energy or other relevant businesses. Guests are also welcome. Women's Energy Network offers growth opportunities to its members through participation on its Board of Directors and special programs. Women's Energy Network is based on the model of the premier women's leadership development program, Leadership Texas, which focuses on networking, education, and community. This includes all Houston area luncheons (energy corridor, downtown, and north side), webinars, and special events such as wine tasting, networking event, fashion events, etc.","Women's Energy Network of Houston""s mission is to is to attract more women into energy through outreach programs. We will retain and develop women in energy by fostering relationships, developing leadership competencies and industry insight through strategic partnerships with companies, educational institutions, and other organizations.",2.01E+17,11777673,990O,9/18/2014 16:54,WOMENS ENERGY NETWORK OF HOUSTON,201312,2014,2013,12,1707 POST OAK BLVD PMB 112,189786,,,HOUSTON,,,Z,Y,48201,2013,0,1,0,628603,0,O,O,EN,C,C,3362,712190,WOMENS ENERGY NETWORK OF HOUSTON TEXAS WENH,C,C60,,,1,,,,IN,,,3360,,199603,0.48878,,TX,6,201312,2014,N,77056,189786,Y,bmf1412co,201312,628603,N,B,C60,C,EN,EN,OT

Today, in every area, our sustainable story dominates civic discussion. We have slowly changed the direction of the City and region, and will continue to capitalize on these gains to realize a vision we know from surveys is shared by the people of Houston. Houston Tomorrow promotes sustainable development of our regions built environment. How we build infrastructure and other facilities impacts whether our citizens have access to quality food and water; to streets that are safe for all users; to greenspaces and parks; to walkable neighborhoods, to a healthier lifestyle, and to a choice of transportation types that includes walking, biking, driving, and transit.##Houston Tomorrow works to align public spending and policies with citizen priorities to distribute scarce infrastructure money in a balanced way among transit, road repair, bike and pedestrian facilities, and new roads. We address issues of equity and work to bring meaningful equity to regional decision making on transportation funding and planning for the future of all our communities.Opportunity Network, a collaboration of public and private entities focused on improving the quality of community and economic opportunity in the region. Houston Tomorrow recognizes that the built environment in our 134 towns and cities is an investment that needs to be maintained and improved, and advocates for sustainable development in many neighborhoods in these existing places, rather than in natural and agricultural lands at the edges of the region.##Houston Tomorrow is recognized as a trusted, independent information source that provides research, analysis, and best practices to keep citizens, policymakers, and business leaders informed about sustainable development. We do this broadly through our website, newsletter, ongoing public events, incisive presentations, input to the policy making process, and white papers and publications.

9.34933E+13,760655841,EFILE,,,,,"OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 4: COMMUNITY OUTREACHThis year, the Conservancy managed over 1,300 volunteers providing over 3,700 work hours in the Park. MPC also went out into the community, speaking to different groups such as the Greater Houston Partnership to the National Honor Society at Lamar High School. The Conservancy also participated in city-wide events including Houston Marathons Charity Village, Earth Day Houston, Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo Nonprofit Partner Program, and Arbor Day. MPC also engaged with current and prospective supporters through the Green Gala, Golf Tournament, and a Fun Run, which included over 1,700 runners in the Park.CAPACITY BUILDINGThe Conservancy is actively building internal infrastructure to prepare for implementation of the Master Plan capital campaign. This included hiring additional staff, bringing total staff to six full-time employees. Board governance and structure was assessed with a professional consulting firm. Technology was upgraded as well as communication materials including redesigning the MPC website, creating and mailing a newsletter, and producing an informative annual report.","The mission of the Memorial Park Conservancy is to restore, preserve and enhance Memorial Park for the enjoyment of all Houstonians, today and tomorrow.","CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AND PARK MAINTENANCEIn September, the Conservancy along with the HPARD broke ground on the new Running Trails Center. When completed, the Center will feature lockers and showers for the use of runners, bicyclists, and other park visitors, vending machines, and office space for the Memorial Park Conservancy. The Center is located on the south side of the Park, near the Living Bridge, and along with amenities, will provide much-needed additional parking. A new stretching deck was installed on the north side of the Park, and was constructed with the assistance of volunteers. The Conservancy continued planning for improvements to the Seymour Lieberman Exer-Trail, including surveying and schematic designs. Improved maintenance of the Park continued with the creation and execution of a new maintenance plan for the Living Bridge, and increased focus on established gardens within the Park, making use of both professionals and volunteers.##MASTER PLANNINGWorking in conjunction with HPARD and Uptown Houston TIRZ, MPC led the process to hire the master planning landscape architecture firm, Nelson Byrd Woltz. The selection process began in FY13. The firm was selected based on their successful experience with large-scale public projects and a keen focus on restoring damaged ecologies. The first six months of the Memorial Park Long-Range Master Planning process consisted of studies and analysis covering topics such as ecology, park use, regional cultural and ecological history, park traffic, security, parking, connectivity, and trends in Houston that will impact the requirements for the Park in the future. Knowing the passion that Houstonians have for Memorial Park, the Conservancy felt it was critical to conduct a robust public input process, conducted by objective, third-party professionals prior to initiating the Master Plan design process. The primary goal was to ensure that all Houstonians, park users, park neighbors, naturalists, conservationists, community groups, user groups and any Houstonian with an interest in the Park shape the future of Memorial Park. The secondary objective of this process was to help inform and educate the public on several topics, including the current state of the parks ecology and challenges the park will likely face in the future. MPC engaged a consulting firm to embed a visitor-focused perspective in the Master Planning process, specifically by helping the master planning team understand the current and future Houston market via an in-depth market study. Some of the information provided in the final report identifies concrete needs or improvements requested by Park users. The report is largely forward looking, providing an analysis of Houstons future market and multiple, city-wide opportunities that may be leveraged to ensure that the improved circulation, facilities, operations and programs serve a multiplicity of uses and elevate the quality of life for all Houstonians.##FORESTRY AND CONSERVATION The forestry and conservation program was enhanced through the hiring of new Conservation Director, Nick Butler. Nick is an ISA-certified Arborist and has a Forestry degree with Environmental Conservation emphasis from Mississippi State University and a Master's degree in Natural Resources from Utah State University. The Conservancy continued the ongoing invasive species and undergrowth removal program on over 200 acres, as well as managed the planting of over 90,000 seedlings of diverse species throughout the Parkthe largest planting in the Parks history. MPC also oversaw stump grinding on 23 acres, helping to prepare for future planting.","Memorial Park Conservancy (MPC) is dedicated to the preservation and enhancement of Memorial Park for today and for future generations; to public use, enjoyment and education in accordance with conditions of the conveyance to the City of Houston by the Hogg Family; and to the on-going support of the Houston Parks and Recreation Department (HPARD).",2.01E+17,11997466,990,11/20/2014 21:25,MEMORIAL PARK CONSERVANCY INC,201405,2014,2014,5,7575 NORTH PICNIC LANE,2556953,,,HOUSTON,,,Z,Y,48201,2014,15,1,0,2088561,0,PC,S,ZA,C,C,3362,813219,MEMORIAL PARK CONSERVANCY INC,C,C113,,,1,,,,IN,,,3360,,200010,0.47764,,TX,3,201405,2014,N,77007,2556953,Y,bmf1412c3,201405,1979067,N,B,C1130,C,EN,EN,OT

More detailed management plans are prepared for properties as KPC undertakes preserve enhancement and restoration activities, including the restoration and creation of wetlands and the enhancement and replanting of native grasslands.##Public Policy and Stewardship - KPC works with various governmental entities to track and monitor public policy that may affect KPC's lands, including major thoroughfare and road plans, flood control initiatives, and conservation easement tax incentives. KPC also monitors its conservation easement lands on an annual basis to ensure that the goals and objectives of the legal agreement between KPC and the impacted landowner are followed and the land in question remains viable for its conservation values. KPC is working to establish more vigorous baseline data on all its preserves and to tract changes over time through regular monitoring protocols.Land Management and Restoration - During 2004-2005, KPC's Board of Directors approved securing a majority ownership of the historic Warren Ranch, a working cattle ranch. The Board determined that the continued operations of the Warren Ranch were part of KPC's mission to protect the unique scenic, historic and natural sites on the Katy Prairie. They noted that well-managed farmland shelters wildlife, supplies scenic open space, and helps filter impurities from our air and water and that these agricultural lands offer many other benefits as well: preservation of open space and natural resources; outdoor recreation, including bird watching, hiking, hunting, and nature tours; improved flood protection; economic development through eco-tourism; enhanced wildlife habitat; recharge zones for the area's aquifers; educational field trips for area youth, and research opportunities for colleges and universities in ecology and land management. The prairie also provides children who might not have an opportunity otherwise to visit a working ranch to ride a horse or tour a farm to see how food is produced - a distinctive outdoor experience.##Land Conservation - The Katy Prairie Conservancy (KPC) protects land on the Katy Prairie in the following ways: acquisition of conservation lands at fair market value, acquisition of conservation lands through a bargain sale arrangement, receipt of donated conservation lands to KPC, receipt of donated trade lands to KPC, donation of conservation easements to KPC, and purchase of development rights on conservation lands on the Katy Prairie. Conservation lands are held in permanent trust and are maintained for the benefit of both the wildlife that inhabit the lands and the public who enjoy visiting KPC's preserves.","Katy Prairie Conservancy (KPC) is dedicated to protecting a sustainable portion of the Katy Prairie for the benefit of its wildlife and the enjoyment of all Texans.

ABNC also manages 300 acres of Texas Coastal Preserve in the Armand Bayou watershed. Marsh restoration maintains appropriate water depth and supports marsh vegetation, such as smooth cord grass and bulrushes replantings. Today this site is thriving, the largest restored marsh on the bayou.##Education: Over 8,500 students of all ages participate in ABNC educational programs annually. School groups participate in Texas Achievement and Knowledge Standards (TAKS) correlated outdoor classes, field trips, and programs featuring nature or historical subjects. ABNC offers outdoor nature camps each summer and winter, scout programs, and community outreaches and conducts numerous informal educational activities including: guided trail hikes, animal demonstrations, hands-on-history craft demonstrations, and guided canoe and pontoon boat bayou explorations.##Visitor & Member Services: Over 15,000 guests visit ABNC annually; another 2,100 member visits are recorded.

Special emphasis is placed on creating an approach that is readily adaptable for urban schools, often with underserved students who traditionally receive few opportunities to participate in environmental education initiatives.Growing Up WILD is an early childhood education program that builds on childrens sense of wonder about nature and invites them to explore wildlife and the world around them. Through a wide range of activities and experiences, Growing Up WILD provides an early foundation for developing positive impressions about the natural world and lifelong social and academic skills.WET in the City engages K-12 youth in hands-on activities that creatively explore the science of water, its cultural context, and complex issues surrounding its management and stewardship. The program is delivered at the local level and targets urban educators with relevant, localized water education.Team WET Schools is a companion program to WET in the City, bringing urban water issues to the forefront of environmental education in school buildings.

Our education and outreach programs occur in a wide variety of formats and reach diverse audiences. During the tax year, TALT's outreach efforts included: a ""Saving Family Lands"" workshop for landowners and their advisors in San Antonio; MCLE presentations given to landowners and attorneys in Midland, Victoria, Amarillo, Lubbock and Fort Worth; A one-day conference, entitled No Land, No Water, at the State Capitol on funding for land conservation; TALT hosted a two day Conservation Finance Network Summit in Houston, Texas focusing on developing funding sources for conservation easements. A second one day summit was held in Austin to further develop funding sources; and TALT partnered with National Fish and Wildlife in a program to communicate with landowners about using the conservation easement to protect certain tall grass prairie wildlife. This included a seminar in Lubbock to communicate how conservation easements can be used to protect the Lesser Prairie Chicken. Through the use of its newsletter, social media and speaking engagements, TALT educates an urban audience regarding the public benefits of rural working lands.##Conservation easements to protect working lands: TALT partners with landowners who seek donated conservation easements, purchase of development rights, and mitigation banks. TALT staff provides professional, efficient, responsive and experienced service for the negotiations of conservation easements. TALT's processes have been developed over the past eight years and incorporate best management practices from the Land Trust Alliance (LTA) and from members of the partnership of rangeland trusts. At the end of the tax year, TALT held conservation easements on nearly 225,000 acres of Texas farms and ranches throughout the state. TALT today is the largest state-based land trust in Texas and numbers among in the top 15 regional or state wide land trusts in the country according to a recent LTA census.","The mission of the Texas Agricultural Land Trust (TALT) is to conserve the Texas heritage of agricultural lands, natural resources and wildlife habitats. TALT works to sustain the long-term stewardship of private lands for the benefit of all Texans. TALT accomplishes its mission through the use of voluntary conservation measures and through education and outreach efforts. TALT partners with private landowners to negotiate and transact conservation easements that protect important conservation values, in accordance with IRC Section 170(h). These privately stewarded lands provide public benefits such as productive agricultural lands, scenic views, drinking water protection, natural wildlife habitat and open space.

School groups participate in Texas Achievement and Knowledge Standards (TAKS) correlated outdoor classes, field trips, and programs featuring nature or historical subjects. ABNC offers outdoor nature camps each summer and winter, scout programs, and community outreaches and conducts numerous informal educational activities including: guided trail hikes, animal demonstrations, hands-on-history craft demonstrations, and guided canoe and pontoon boat bayou explorations.##Stewardship: ABNC preserves one of the most extensive holdings of coastal tall-grass prairie in the lower Galveston Bay watershed. Currently, 900 acres are actively managed within our current boundaries. Prairie lands are being restored through controlled burns and mowing to reduce invasive species and by replanting native grasses. ABNC also manages 300 acres of Texas Coastal Preserve in the Armand Bayou watershed. Marsh restoration maintains appropriate water depth and supports marsh vegetation, such as smooth cord grass and bulrushes replantings. Today this site is thriving, the largest restored marsh on the bayou.##Visitor & Member Services: Over 15,000 guests visit ABNC annually; another 2,100 member visits are recorded. Almost 4,000 people travel to ABNC for meetings or private events each year. Visitors follow the self-guided Discovery Trail interpretive loop; some venture out on over 5 miles of developed hiking trails. The education facilities and historical farm site offer 'special places' for family retreats, company meetings or seasonal parties.

KPC also monitors its conservation easement lands on an annual basis to ensure that the goals and objectives of the legal agreement between KPC and the impacted landowner are followed and the land in question remains viable for its conservation values. KPC is working to establish more vigorous baseline data on all its preserves and to tract changes over time through regular monitoring protocols.Land Management and Restoration - During 2004-2005, KPC's Board of Directors approved securing a majority ownership of the historic Warren Ranch, a working cattle ranch. The Board determined that the continued operations of the Warren Ranch were part of KPC's mission to protect the unique scenic, historic and natural sites on the Katy Prairie. They noted that well-managed farmland shelters wildlife, supplies scenic open space, and helps filter impurities from our air and water and that these agricultural lands offer many other benefits as well: preservation of open space and natural resources; outdoor recreation, including bird watching, hiking, hunting, and nature tours; improved flood protection; economic development through eco-tourism; enhanced wildlife habitat; recharge zones for the area's aquifers; educational field trips for area youth, and research opportunities for colleges and universities in ecology and land management. The prairie also provides children who might not otherwise have an opportunity to visit a working ranch to ride a horse or tour a farm to see how food is produced - a distinctive outdoor experience.","Long-term goals are to: protect 50,000 acres; allow public access; ensure responsible stewardship of protected lands; restore and enhance wildlife habitat; offer educational programs; and conduct and facilitate appropriate research to accomplish KPCs mission.","Land Conservation - The Katy Prairie Conservancy (KPC) protects land on the Katy Prairie in the following ways: acquisition of conservation lands at fair market value, acquisition of conservation lands through a bargain sale arrangement, receipt of donated conservation lands to KPC, receipt of donated trade lands to KPC, donation of conservation easements to KPC, and purchase of development rights on conservation lands on the Katy Prairie. Conservation lands are held in permanent trust and are maintained for the benefit of both the wildlife that inhabit the lands and the public who enjoy visiting KPC's preserves.##Public Policy and Stewardship - KPC works with various governmental entities to track and monitor public policy that may affect KPC's lands, including major thoroughfare and road plans, flood control initiatives, and conservation easement tax incentives. KPC also monitors its conservation easement lands on an annual basis to ensure that the goals and objectives of the legal agreement between KPC and the impacted landowner are followed and the land in question remains viable for its conservation values. KPC is working to establish more vigorous baseline data on all its preserves and to tract changes over time through regular monitoring protocols.Land Management and Restoration - During 2004-2005, KPC's Board of Directors approved securing a majority ownership of the historic Warren Ranch, a working cattle ranch. The Board determined that the continued operations of the Warren Ranch were part of KPC's mission to protect the unique scenic, historic and natural sites on the Katy Prairie. They noted that well-managed farmland shelters wildlife, supplies scenic open space, and helps filter impurities from our air and water and that these agricultural lands offer many other benefits as well: preservation of open space and natural resources; outdoor recreation, including bird watching, hiking, hunting, and nature tours; improved flood protection; economic development through eco-tourism; enhanced wildlife habitat; recharge zones for the area's aquifers; educational field trips for area youth, and research opportunities for colleges and universities in ecology and land management. The prairie also provides children who might not otherwise have an opportunity to visit a working ranch to ride a horse or tour a farm to see how food is produced - a distinctive outdoor experience.##Preserve Enhancement - KPC has developed general management plans for all its protected properties that ensure that the lands are not further degraded by invasive species (including Chinese Tallow, McCartney Rose, feral hogs and other feral animals) and are maintained in their traditional uses. More detailed management plans are prepared for properties as KPC undertakes preserve enhancement and restoration activities, including the restoration and creation of wetlands and the enhancement and replanting of native grasslands.","Katy Prairie Conservancy (KPC) is dedicated to protecting a sustainable portion of the Katy Prairie for the benefit of its wildlife and the enjoyment of all Texans. KPC conserves land, restores and enhances wildlife habitat through grassland and wetlands projects, and educates the public on the value and importance of prairies.",2.02E+17,12875084,990,9/18/2015,KATY PRAIRIE CONSERVANCY,201412,2015,2014,12,5615 KIRBY DR STE 867,34946731,,,HOUSTON,,,Z,Y,48201,2014,15,1,0,3462877,0,PC,O,EN,C,C,3360,813312,KATY PRAIRIE CONSERVANCY,C,C30,,,,,,,IN,,,,,199211,0.87749,,TX,3,201412,2016,N,77005,34946731,Y,bmf1608c3,201412,3425466,N,B,C30,C,EN,EN,OT

HAS staff and dedicated volunteers manage its sanctuaries with a focus on habitat restoration, invasive species control, bird monitoring and protection, and public access enhancement. In addition, HAS works with communities and partner organizations to improve native habitats for birds throughout the greater Houston area. This year HAS expanded its Natives Nursery, making native wildflowers and grasses available to partners for urban demonstration gardens, pocket prairies, and local gardeners wishing to enhance landscapes to benefit wildlife.##ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION & OUTREACH: This year HAS provided 874 innovative natural science program experiences to over 36,000 children and adults at its two urban nature centers and through its extensive programming taken on the road throughout the Houston-Galveston area. Program offerings included nature camps, school outreach programs, and scout workshops for children as well as birding classes, field trips and citizen science bird monitoring programs for all ages. In addition, HAS expanded its reach in two ways: 1) through virtual fieldtrips hosted from the Sims Bayou Urban Nature Center, making available live bird conservation educational presentations to schools across the U.S., Canada and Mexico; and 2) by bringing the birds and bird education to residents at Alzheimers and memory care facilities though a new program called Bird Tales.",The vision of Houston Audubon Society (HAS) is the creation of a healthier natural environment and a more beautiful place to live by leading and nurturing a community that values and supports birds.,2.02E+17,12701375,990,7/22/2015,HOUSTON AUDUBON SOCIETY INC,201406,2015,2014,6,440 WILCHESTER BLVD,6862195,,,HOUSTON,,,Z,Y,48201,2014,16,1,0,2315479,0,PC,O,EN,C,C,3362,813312,HOUSTON AUDUBON SOCIETY,C,C30,,,1,,,,IN,,,3360,,197001,0.35511,,TX,3,201406,2015,N,77079,6862195,Y,bmf1512c3,201406,1909454,N,A,C30,C,EN,EN,OT

The Grand Gateway, the historic main entrance to Hermann Park, will benefit from extensive landscaping surrounding the Sam Houston Monument and Mecom Fountain. Improved walkways, pedestrian-scale lighting, benches, bike racks, and new drainage and irrigation will be added to the stretch of parkland from the Mecom Fountain to Cambridge Street. Groundbreaking for the McGovern Centennial Gardens in September 2013 marked the start of the $31 million project to transform Hermann Parks 15-acre Garden Center into the McGovern Centennial Gardens. The Gardens will feature a rose garden, an arid garden, an interactive family garden, a great lawn, a woodland garden, a 30-foot garden mount and a sculpture promenade. Construction also began on the Cherie Flores Garden Pavilion designed by the architecture firm Bohlin Cywinski Jackson. The new building will act as a main gateway to the McGovern Centennial Gardens and provide rental space, along with the Celebration Garden, for the Houston community. Hermann Parks Japanese Garden was improved with the aid of a professional garden team from Japan, led by gardener Hiroshi Iwasaki. The focus was on tree and shrub pruning and trimming in true Japanese style, fence building, and design for specific areas of the garden.##Visitor Services The Visitor Services department was developed in 2008 when Hermann Park Conservancy was awarded the contract by the City of Houston to manage the Hermann Park train. Specifically, Visitor Services oversees and operates Hermann Park train and the pedal boats, and coordinates activities with the Conservancy gift shop, cafe, and food vendors. The 10 to 15 member staff are responsible for creating an exciting and memorable experience for park visitors and to ensure Lake Plaza is operating efficiently and safely. Additionally, its maintenance team is responsible for the cleaning and upkeep of Lake Plaza.##Park Programs and Maintenance The Conservancys maintenance program assists the Houston parks department with the maintenance of Hermann Park. Responsibilities include maintaining and cleaning the parks grounds, water areas, and hardscapes; planting and watering trees; and weeding. The Volunteer and Education department supports maintenance, horticulture, and reforestation efforts, while engaging the public in community building, teaching valuable skills, and imparting knowledge about the park.",Hermann Park Conservancy is a citizens' organization dedicated to the stewardship and improvement of Hermann Park - today and for generations to come.,2.02E+17,12638757,990,7/6/2015,HERMANN PARK CONSERVANCY,201406,2015,2014,6,6201 A HERMANN PARK DRIVE,33380470,,,HOUSTON,,,Z,Y,48201,2014,15,1,0,13090622,0,PC,O,EN,C,C,3362,813312,HERMANN PARK CONSERVANCY,C,C50,,,1,,,,IN,,,3360,,199104,0.51473,,TX,3,201406,2015,N,77030,33380470,Y,bmf1512c3,201406,7412836,N,A,C50,C,EN,EN,OT

Collectively, we opened the new Running Trails Center to the public in 2014. As the newest public building in Memorial Park in more than twenty years, the Center features lockers and showers for the use of runners, bicyclists and other park visitors along with vending machines and office space for the Conservancy. The Center provides much-needed additional parking for park visitors, a project which benefitted greatly from support from the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. Other essential projects that were recently completed include the refurbishment of the popular Seymour Lieberman Exer-Trail in collabortion with Uptown Houston TIRZ, as well as the rehabilitation of the natural surface trails on the south side of the Park.##PARK CARENatural resource management and maintenance of Memorial Park are the most labor intensive of the many needs of this urban Park. This care is delivered through Memorial Park Conservancy (MPC) programs and staff in conjunction with the Houston Parks and Recreation Department (HPARD). This years conservation program included convening an Eco-Tech panel of area experts that met frequently throughout the year to address and find solutions for ecological issues within the Park, treating approximately 415 acres for invasive species as well as site preparation of a portion of the treated acreage to prepare for the forestry and conservation projects identified by the Memorial Park Master Plan. The Conservancy also conducted an in-depth tree inventory to build on existing landscaped areas inventory and as well as habitat assessment in select locations. In addition to ecological care of the natural environment, sensitive maintenance has been the focus of the Conservancys volunteer and community outreach program. Through this program, more than 3,300 volunteer hours were contributed in 2014 toward the rehabilitation and beautification of the Park, all while working alongside professional staff and avocational horticulturists such as Master Naturalists and Master Gardeners. In addition to work inside Memorial Park, staff went out into the Houston community, speaking to various groups to continue to educate others on the needs of the Park. Additionally, we again engaged with current and prospective supporters through our annual events such as the Green Gala, Golf Tournament and the Brunch Run, which brought more than 1,800 runners to the Park. Finally, the Conservancy provided the financial resources to HPARD to hire two full-time maintenance workers in the Park, improving the day-to-day care and user experience.##MASTER PLANNINGWorking in conjunction with HPARD and Uptown Houston TIRZ (Uptown), MPC continued the Parks master planning process with landscape architecture firm Nelson Byrd Woltz, culminating in passing of the plan in April 2015 by Houston City Council. The master planning team facilitated studies and analysis covering topics such as ecology, park use, cultural and ecological history, traffic, security, parking, connectivity and trends in Houston that will impact the requirements for the Park in the future. MPC also contracted with ETM & Associates, nationally recognized experts in public space and park management, to provide a comprehensive plan for maintaining proposed projects of the Master Plan. The Conservancy continued to build and strengthen internal infrastructure to prepare for implementation of the Master Plan and a supporting Capital Campaign. In 2014 this included hiring additional staff, bringing the total number of staff to seven full-time employees. Board governance and structure continued to be strengthened. Park users and interested public were provided increased opportunities to communicate with the Conservancy and learn about Memorial Park through enhanced social media campaigns, print and electronic newsletters, and publication of the annual report.","Memorial Park Conservancy (MPC) is dedicated to the preservation and enhancement of Memorial Park for today and for future generations; to public use, enjoyment and education in accordance with conditions of the conveyance to the City of Houston.",2.02E+17,13093928,990,1/8/2016,MEMORIAL PARK CONSERVANCY INC,201505,2016,2015,5,7575 N PICNIC,1939810,,,HOUSTON,,,Z,Y,48201,2015,15,1,0,1694621,0,PC,S,ZA,C,C,3360,813219,MEMORIAL PARK CONSERVANCY INC,C,C113,,,,,,,IN,,,,,200010,0.58675,,TX,3,201505,2016,N,77007,1939810,Y,bmf1608c3,201505,1518538,N,B,C1130,C,EN,EN,OT

Trees For Houston has expanded the nursery program to include six tree farms. We currently have about 20,000 trees of various species and sizes growing at these farms.","Trees For Houston grows, plants and maintains trees throughout the greater Houston area. Mission related activities include outdoor and in-class educational programming, volunteer projects, and urban forestry information, as well as the management of six tree farms.","Trees For Houston's projects include, purchasing, planting and caring for trees. The organization's role in any given project varies greatly, as the needs and abilities of various partners in the public and private sectors are engaged in the planting of trees.The organization works with public and private sectors, encourages the involvement of corporate, foundation and individual partners and is responsible for the planting of over 513,000 trees and seedlings in the last thirty years along streets, in neighborhoods, and parks throughout the Houston region. During the 2014/2015 planting season, Trees For Houston planted and maintained 26,360 trees and watered an additional 2,882 under its planned maintenance program.##The mission of the Trees For Houston Education Program is to expand the awareness of the critical role that trees play in our community for residents of all ages and grade levels. In addition to planting trees at a minimum of 25 schools per year, Trees For Houston conducts education presentations to school children and adults throughout the region. During the 2014-2015 planting season our classroom education program provided Growing Together kits containing native tree seed, soil, container and ruler to nearly 1,200 students. Our hands-on planting events educated more than 1,200 adults and children on proper tree planting, protection and care, and we presented tree planting information and materials to over 11,000 people at outreach events, including civic association, garden club and professional organization meetings.##Nearly 600 public and private schools have over 38,000 trees thanks to our Trees for Schools program. Schools are chosen based on recommendations from parents, teachers, principals, neighbors, and administrators. Trees For Houston surveys the school grounds with the school staff to determined the number and species of trees that should be planted.After the trees are planted, Trees For Houston waters, stakes, and mulches for a minimum of two years to ensure their survival.

Trained citizen scientists augment professional monitoring data and aid in watershed planning through GBFs Water Monitoring Team, Bacteria Sampling Program, and Water Quality Internships. In 2014, the Water Monitoring Team grew to 53 volunteers who sampled from 52 sites, including 18 who sampled for Enterococcus bacteria from 20 sites. The Foundation is actively engaged in discussion and planning on improving coastal resiliency and also advocates for the allocation of research dollars to the region to ensure the health of Galveston Bay and its users.",The Galveston Bay Foundation works to ensure a clean and healthy Galveston Bay that can be enjoyed by people today and for generations to come. Our diverse programs preserve and protect Texas largest and most productive estuary.,"Conservation programs focus on estuarine habitat preservation, protection, and restoration. Land preservation work included closing on the purchases of the 17.23-acre Cedar Gully property and the 30.975-acre Cotton Bayou property, both in Chambers County, and obtaining conservation easements on the 178-acre Exploration Green tract in Harris County and the 1,100-acre Lone Pine Farm tract in Brazoria County. GBF committed Knobloch funds to members of the Partnership for Gulf Coast Land Conservation to help pay for due diligence costs associated with 13 land acquisition projects targeting Deepwater Horizon settlement funds for the conservation of more than 42,200 acres across all 5 Gulf states. Habitat restoration work included removing 3 derelict and abandoned steel barges from Cedar Bayou; completing work on the Pine Gully Wetlands Restoration project by constructing a pair of jetties at the mouth of the gully, dredging sediments out of the gully, and planting the banks with smooth cordgrass to restore about 2.5 acres of wetlands; and installing oyster bags along the shorelines of the Sweetwater Nature Preserve, including 80 feet along Sweetwater Lake and 55 feet along West Bay. We continued to recycle oyster shell from Tommys Oyster Bar, Topwater Grill, the Kemah Boardwalk, Crazy Alans Swamp Shack, and Number 13 at Pelican Rest Marina, reclaiming an estimated 127.8 tons of shell during 2014. We completed construction on one private landowner living shoreline project and began construction on another. We also hosted community-based habitat enhancement events including TPWDs annual Abandoned Crab Trap Removal event at the Fort Anahuac Park site, in which we removed 273 crab traps (over 80% of the total traps collected in/around Galveston Bay) with the assistance of 40 volunteers, 8 airboats, and 4 outboard boats; Trash Bash at Bay Area Park, with 832 volunteers collecting an estimated 7.5 tons of trash and recyclables from the Armand Bayou watershed; and Marsh Mania events involving 403 volunteers in planting 4.63 acres of estuarine inter tidal marsh at 5 restoration sites.##Education programs provide science-based environmental education focused on Galveston Bay. Our education programs allowed GBF to reach thousands of youth and adults in 2014. We hosted the Bay Day Festival at the Kemah Boardwalk, with 33 exhibits, support from 30 volunteers, participation by 120 kids in the Blue Crab Scavenger Hunt, and an estimated attendance of over 5,000 visitors; and the eighth annual Bike Around the Bay sponsored by Shell with more than 1,000 registered riders. We concluded the 2013-14 Get Hip to Habitat year by serving 1,100 students at 18 schools and kicked off the 2014-15 school year with participation by 22 schools. We installed an additional 46 seafood consumption advisory signs at 23 fishing and crabbing locations on local waters, ranging from the upper Houston Ship Channel at Brays Bayou down to Upper Galveston Bay in La Porte, and cemented 180 storm drain medallions at storm drain openings on the east end of Galveston Island in the residential areas south of UTMB with the help of Ball High School students. We launched the Dockwalker pilot program, which concluded that about half of the boaters surveyed at six marinas did not know the consequences of illegally discharging sewage overboard, justifying the need for continued education about the impacts of boater waste on the bay, and kicked off the Galveston Bay Report Card project, beginning with input about bay health topics obtained from more than 540 member and public surveys and 31 presentations to 800 individuals from various stakeholder groups. We also debuted a new website and mobile-friendly e-news format in 2014.##Advocacy programs attempt to balance the multiple uses of Galveston Bay so that the long-term interests of the Bay itself are not compromised. As a result of the Texas City Y Oil Spill in March 2014, GBF was activated as the Volunteer Coordinator and managed the Sentinel Program for 17 days, mobilizing 230 volunteers in walking 100 miles of Galveston beachfront looking for incidences of oil and oiled wildlife. GBF provided eight Rain Barrel Workshops in Baytown, Dickinson, Galveston, Houston, La Porte, and Nassau Bay, with 507 people in attendance and 517 rain barrels and kits distributed, reducing a potential of 540,000 gallons of storm water runoff and conserving water for Galveston Bay. GBF advocated for more meaningful water conservation goals in the City of Houston by making written comments on the draft 2014 City of Houston Water Conservation Plan, authoring a Houston Chronicle op-ed that generated an editorial and front page article, and addressing Mayor Annise Parker and City Council members. We cultivated partnerships with members of the Gulf Coast Water Efficiency Network by leading the efforts to launch a water conservation yard sign campaign targeting discretionary outdoor water use and advocated for environmental and water conservation considerations to be included during the rule making process of House Bill 4/State Water Implementation Fund for Texas (SWIFT) through oral and written comments to Texas Water Development Board. We continued Clean Water Partnerships with 19 marinas, 2 schools, and 4 cities, including a new partnership with the City of La Porte. Our volunteer Wetland Permit Review Committee reviewed 45 applications for Corps of Engineers permits and provided letters of concern or comments on 20 of them.","The mission of the Galveston Bay Foundation is to preserve, protect, and enhance the natural resources of the Galveston Bay estuarine system and its tributaries for present users and for posterity.",2.02E+17,13157582,990,1/28/2016,GALVESTON BAY FOUNDATION INC,201412,2016,2014,12,1100 HERCULES AVE STE 200,3650321,,,HOUSTON,,,Z,Y,48201,2014,15,1,0,4684279,0,PC,O,EN,C,C,3360,813312,GALVESTON BAY FOUNDATION,C,C32,,,,,,,IN,,,,,198805,0.38998,,TX,3,201412,2016,N,77058,3650321,Y,bmf1608c3,201412,4619660,N,A,C32,C,EN,EN,OT

Today, in every area, our sustainable story dominates civic discussion. We have slowly changed the direction of the City and region, and will continue to capitalize on these gains to realize a vision we know from surveys is shared by the people of Houston. Houston Tomorrow promotes sustainable development of our regions built environment. How we build infrastructure and other facilities impacts whether our citizens have access to quality food and water; to streets that are safe for all users; to greenspaces and parks; to walkable neighborhoods, to a healthier lifestyle, and to a choice of transportation types that includes walking, biking, driving, and transit. (Continued below.)##Houston Tomorrow works to align public spending and policies with citizen priorities to distribute scarce infrastructure money in a balanced way among transit, road repair, bike and pedestrian facilities, and new roads. We address issues of equity and work to bring meaningful equity to regional decision making on transportation funding and planning for the future of all our communities. Houston Tomorrow recognizes that the built environment in our 134 towns and cities is an investment that needs to be maintained and improved, and advocates for sustainable development in many neighborhoods in these existing places, rather than in natural and agricultural lands at the edges of the region.

It is the Foundations practice that a sectarian organization must be listed in the Official Catholic Directory. Of these sectarian grants, about 70% are made in the South Texas area which includes the Diocese of Brownsville, the Diocese of Corpus Christi, and the Diocese of Laredo. Education has been strongly favored in recent grant giving cycles including tuition assistance for Catholic schools, and scholarships for Catholic and public universities. Service organizations and Catholic charities which target health, human services, the indigent, equal opportunity, and service to others are also favored.

The gardens feature a rose garden, a family garden, an arid garden, a great lawn, a woodland garden and a 30-foot garden mount giving visitors a panoramic view of the entire garden. The Cherie Flores Garden Pavilion, designed by the architecture firm Bohlin Cywinski Jackson, serves as the gateway to the gardens and is also a rental facility for the community. In FY15, planning began for the restoration of Hermann Parks historic clubhouse, built in 1933. Once complete, the clubhouse will function as a rental facility securing earned income to supplement the Conservancys maintenance program for the Park. Planning and fundraising was also underway for a renovation of the Japanese Garden ahead of its 25th anniversary in 2017. In addition to structural improvements to be made by the City of Houston, the Conservancy began planning for specialty projects for the garden including a new Japanese-style gate on the Fannin Street side to make the garden more accessible.##Visitor Services - The Visitor Services department was developed in 2008 when Hermann Park Conservancy was awarded the contract by the City of Houston to manage the Hermann Park Railroad. Visitor Services oversees and operates the train and pedal boats and coordinates activities with the Conservancy Gift Shop, Pinewood Cafe, and food vendors throughout the Park. Visitor Services manages facility rentals for events at the new Cherie Flores Garden Pavilion and Celebration Garden in the McGovern Centennial Gardens. The department hosts special programs at Lake Plaza including a yearly birthday party for Park namesake, George Hermann, a holiday party with arts and crafts and other activities, and student performances. Approximately 25 staff members are responsible for creating an exciting and memorable experience for Park visitors and keep Lake Plaza operating efficiently and safely. The maintenance team is responsible for the cleaning and upkeep of Lake Plaza.##Park Programs and Maintenance The Conservancys maintenance program assists the Houston Parks and Recreation Department with the maintenance of Hermann Park. Responsibilities include maintaining and cleaning the Parks grounds, water areas, and hardscapes; planting and watering trees; and weeding. The Conservancy has taken on the maintenance program for the 15-acre McGovern Centennial Gardens and parking area that opened in December 2014. A team of 12 full- and part-time gardeners and maintenance workers keep the gardens and landscaped parking lot in top condition, ensuring that the gardens are well tended through each season. The volunteer program supports the McGovern Centennial Gardens staff as well as lending a hand throughout the Park.

See below for a description of each of CEE's educational programs.Project WILD is a supplementary, interdisciplinary, instructional program for educators of students in kindergarten through high school that is balanced and fair, neither pro nor con on value-sensitive issues. Project WILD's mission is to provide wildlife-based conservation and environmental education that fosters responsible actions toward wildlife and related natural resources. The goal of Project WILD is to assist learners of any age in developing awareness, knowledge, skills and commitment to result in informed decisions, responsible behavior and constructive actions concerning wildlife and the environment upon which all life depends.The Flying WILD program engages middle schools in bird education efforts with the intent of encouraging increased environmental stewardship among youth. Special emphasis is placed on creating an approach that is readily adaptable for urban schools, often with underserved students who traditionally receive few opportunities to participate in environmental education initiatives.Growing Up WILD is an early childhood education program that builds on childrens sense of wonder about nature and invites them to explore wildlife and the world around them. Through a wide range of activities and experiences, Growing Up WILD provides an early foundation for developing positive impressions about the natural world and lifelong social and academic skills.WET in the City engages K-12 youth in hands-on activities that creatively explore the science of water, its cultural context, and complex issues surrounding its management and stewardship.

FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS, RGISC HAS CONDUCTED MONTHLY SAMPLING OF WATER AT MULTIPLE POINTS ALONG THE RIVER AND SUBMITTING THE DATA TO FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES. NUEVO LAREDO WATER TESTING RGISC HAS WORKED CONSISTENTLY OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES WITH OFFICIALS FROM OUR SISTER CITY IN MEXICO, NUEVO LAREDO, TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF RAW SEWER THAT IS DISCHARGED EACH DAY INTO THE RIVER. AT PRESENT, RELEASES NEARLY 6 MILLION GALLONS OF UNTREATED WASTEWATER INTO THE RIVER EACH DAY, CREATING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGH LEVELS OF E. COLI AND COLIFORM BACTERIA. MOST OF THIS COMES FROM SEWER LINES THAT ARE EITHER ILLEGALLY HOOKED UP TO STORM DRAINS OR ILLEGALLY CHANNELED INTO CREEKS SUCH AS LA JOYA AND LAS ALAZANAS. IN SEPTEMBER 2015, RGISC CONDUCTED WATER TESTING AT SIX SITES ALONG NUEVO LAREDO'S LONG, MEANDERING CREEK SYSTEM KNOWN AS COYOTE. RESULTS SHOWED VERY LOW OXYGEN LEVELS DUE TO HIGH NUTRIENTS AND SOLIDS FROM SOLID WASTE AND POSSIBLY HEAVY METALS. FURTHER TESTING IS NEEDED. IN LATE JANUARY 2015, RGISC ALSO INVESTIGATED THE SOURCE OF THE 3 MILLION GALLONS OF DAILY UNTREATED WASTEWATER EMPTYING INTO THE RIVER FROM NUEVO LAREDO'S ARROYO LA JOYA. FRACKING INSIDE CITY LIMITS IN THE SPRING OF 2015, A NEW TYPE OF URBAN PHENOMENON ENTERED CITY LIMITS - HORIZONTAL DRILLING AND HYDRAULIC FRACTURING.

THE 2015 SERIES OF ""NEIGHBORS OF OIL & GAS"" PRESENTATIONS WERE DELIVERED IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH IN THE CITIES AND TOWNS OF CUERO, KARNES CITY, COTULLA, LAREDO, PLEASANTON, CARRIZO SPRINGS AND COLLEGE STATION. PLASTIC BAG REDUCTION CAMPAIGN IN APRIL 30, 2015, THE LAREDO PLASTIC BAG REDUCTION ORDINANCE TOOK EFFECT, WITH A GOAL OF REDUCING THE NEARLY 120 MILLION PLASTIC BAGS CONSUMED EACH YEAR IN LAREDO. RGISC WORKED WITH HUNDREDS OF VOLUNTEERS, BUSINESS OWNERS, RELIGIOUS AND CIVIC LEADERS, EDUCATORS AND CITY STAFF OVER A 10-YEAR PERIOD TO GET THIS ORDINANCE PASSED. IN 2015, IT CONTINUED ITS EDUCATION AWARENESS CAMPAIGN BY DISTRIBUTING THOUSANDS OF LOVING LAREDO REUSABLE BAGS AT MULTIPLE EVENTS, AND HOLDING TALKS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH MULTIPLE GROUPS AND AT MULTIPLE SCHOOLS, AS WELL AS MONITORING LEGAL HEARINGS IN A LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST THE CITY BY A SMALL GROUP OF MERCHANTS.

9.34932E+13,260161807,EFILE,,,,,,Conserving the Texas heritage of agricultural lands.,"Outreach on conservation easements to communicate the public benefits of private, working lands: TALT's outreach work falls into two categories: to educate landowners and their advisors on how to use conservation easements to protect, conserve and pass land down to future generations; and to communicate the need to protect agricultural lands and open space, and the many benefits - such as clean and plentiful drinking water, domestic and affordable food and fiber, and wildlife habitat - that these lands provide to all Texans. Our education and outreach programs occur in a wide variety of formats and reach diverse audiences. During the tax year, TALT's outreach efforts included: workshops in Alpine, Uvalde and Corpus Christi for landowners and their advisors; MCLE presentations given to landowners and attorneys in Amarillo and San Antonio; TALT hosted a one day follow up meeting with the attendees from the Conservation Finance Network Summit focusing on developing funding sources for conservation easements; multiple speaking engagements with strategic partner organizations such as Society for Rangeland Management, Texas Parks and Wildlife, Texas Masternaturalist, Texas Wildlife Association and Texas State University. TALT also initiated the No Land No Water campaign to successfully garner funding support for the Texas Farms and Ranch Land Conservation Program through legislative action. In addition, TALTs work at the federal level helped to make permanent the deduction for the donated conservation easement. Through the use of its newsletter, social media and speaking engagements, TALT educates an urban audience regarding the public benefits of rural working lands.##Conservation easements to protect working lands: TALT partners with landowners who seek donated conservation easements, purchase of development rights, and mitigation banks. TALT staff provides professional, efficient, responsive and experienced service for the negotiations of conservation easements. TALT's processes have been developed over the past nine years and incorporate best management practices from the Land Trust Alliance (LTA) and from members of the partnership of rangeland trusts. At the end of the tax year, TALT held conservation easements on nearly 225,000 acres of Texas farms and ranches throughout the state. TALT today is the largest state-based land trust in Texas and numbers among in the top 15 regional or state wide land trusts in the country according to a recent LTA census.","The mission of the Texas Agricultural Land Trust (TALT) is to conserve the Texas heritage of agricultural lands, natural resources and wildlife habitats. TALT works to sustain the long-term stewardship of private lands for the benefit of all Texans. TALT accomplishes its mission through the use of voluntary conservation measures and through education and outreach efforts. TALT partners with private landowners to negotiate and transact conservation easements that protect important conservation values, in accordance with IRC Section 170(h). These privately stewarded lands provide public benefits such as productive agricultural lands, scenic views, drinking water protection, natural wildlife habitat and open space. Additionally, with a state that holds 94% privately owned lands, TALT works to educate the public on the many public benefits provided by the stewardship of private lands, and to educate Texas landowners about the use of conservation easements.

Once completed, this environmental park will contribute to the restoration and enhancement of Buffalo Bayou and the downstream coastal ecosystems it impacts. Buffalo Bend will provide East End residents a direct link to the heritage of the city and a higher quality of life that offers hiking, bird watching, environmental education and most importantly, a sense of wilderness that many locals from this community rarely have the opportunity to experience. OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 5: Conservation - Buffalo Bayou Partnerships Conservation Program encompasses multiple park spaces and other wild areas along the bayou. Conservation efforts take place at Shepherd Drive and extend as far as the Port of Houston turning basin in the East End. Activities include understory and tree planting in the fall and winter and invasive plant removal in the spring and summer. Other activities include watering (as necessary), trash clean-up/removal, and herbicide treatment to invasive trees, such as Chinese Tallow and China Berry. OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 6: Land Acquisition - BBP has an ongoing land acquisition program for trails and facilities along both sides of Buffalo Bayou from Shepherd Drive to Lockwood Drive. OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 7: Sunset Coffee Building (formerly known as the International Coffee Building) - Built in 1910, the facility is being transformed into Buffalo Bayou's premier recreational and cultural center. The building will include an outdoor plaza, biking and boating rental facility, historical exhibits, and a rooftop terrace. An earnest money contract for sale of the building to a local government entity of the City upon completion of its renovation was executed in May, 2012. OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 8: A top priority of Buffalo Bayou Partnership is to build a continuous system of trails on the north and south banks of Buffalo Bayou from Shepherd Drive to the Turning Basin. This will give Houstonians and visitors 20 miles of trails to run, walk and bike along our waterway. To accommodate residents and visitors who want to enjoy a walk or jog along the Shepherd Drive to Sabine Street stretch of the bayou, BBP added asphalt footpaths closer to the waterway. OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 9: Clean & Green Program - A project with the Port of Houston and Shell Oil that utilizes community service workers to clean the bayou of trash and debris. OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 10: Buffalo Bayou Partnership's Bayou Buddies is a membership and events group made up of young professionals dedicated to BBP's mission to transform and revitalize Buffalo Bayou, Houston's greatest natural resource.

Today, in every area, our sustainable story dominates civic discussion. We have slowly changed the direction of the City and region, and will continue to capitalize on these gains to realize a vision we know from surveys is shared by the people of Houston. Houston Tomorrow promotes sustainable development of our regions built environment. How we build infrastructure and other facilities impacts whether our citizens have access to quality food and water; to streets that are safe for all users; to greenspaces and parks; to walkable neighborhoods, to a healthier lifestyle, and to a choice of transportation types that includes walking, biking, driving, and transit. (Continued below.)##Houston Tomorrow works to align public spending and policies with citizen priorities to distribute scarce infrastructure money in a balanced way among transit, road repair, bike and pedestrian facilities, and new roads. We address issues of equity and work to bring meaningful equity to regional decision making on transportation funding and planning for the future of all our communities. Houston Tomorrow recognizes that the built environment in our 134 towns and cities is an investment that needs to be maintained and improved, and advocates for sustainable development in many neighborhoods in these existing places, rather than in natural and agricultural lands at the edges of the region. (continued below)##Houston Tomorrow is recognized as a trusted, independent information source that provides research, analysis, and best practices to keep citizens, policymakers, and business leaders informed about sustainable development. We do this broadly through our website, newsletter, ongoing public events, incisive presentations, input to the policy making process, and white papers and publications. Houston Tomorrow tackles big issues that other organizations are unwilling or unable to address, and thus stands alone in Houston as the primary proponent of broad principles for sustainable development that improves the environment, community,and economy.","Our mission is to improve the quality of life for all the people of the Houston region.

GBF continued to be actively engaged in discussion and planning on improving coastal resiliency and to advocate for the allocation of research dollars to the region to ensure the health of Galveston Bay and its users.",The Galveston Bay Foundation works to ensure a clean and healthy Galveston Bay that can be enjoyed by people today and for generations to come. Our diverse programs preserve and protect Texas largest and most productive estuary.,"GBFs conservation programs focus on estuarine habitat preservation, protection, and restoration. Continuing our work as a nationally accredited land trust, GBF acquired conservation easements on two properties1) a 675-acre tract that is part of Harris County Flood Control Districts mitigation bank near Greens Bayou in northeast Houston that serves to offset wetland impacts associated with future flood control efforts in Harris County and 2) a 1,700-acre tract consisting of high quality coastal wetland and prairie habitat known as Gordy Marsh near Smith Point in Chambers County. In our role as a facilitator for conservation work across the Gulf states, GBF obligated funds from the Knobloch Family Foundation to members of the Partnership for Gulf Coast Land Conservation to help pay for due diligence costs associated with 20 land acquisition projects targeting Deepwater Horizon settlement funds for the proposed conservation of more than 28,000 acres across all five Gulf States. We also worked extensively to restore degraded habitats around Galveston Bay. In 2015, we removed 19 abandoned and derelict vessels from locations all around the Bay; created, restored, and enhanced approximately 50 acres of freshwater wetlands and adjacent prairie habitat at our Rich Sanctuary property as part of the Wetland Reserve Program; created a 30-acre freshwater wetland for waterfowl and enhanced over 150 acres of existing man-made wetlands on the Austin Bayou Woods property to provide habitat for waterfowl, wading birds, and other wetland dependent species; worked with three private landowners and a county park to create living shorelines on their waterfronts; and put to use our first funds stemming from the BP oil spill via NFWFs Gulf Environmental Benefit Fund on the Oyster Lake and Moses Lake/Dollar Bay projects. Our oyster programs ranged from oyster shell recycling to oyster gardening, to nearshore reef restoration. We welcomed a new restaurantCaptain Bennys Seafoodinto the oyster shell recycling program and continued collecting oyster shell from Tommys Oyster Bar, Topwater Grill, the Kemah Boardwalk, and Crazy Alans Swamp Shack, reclaiming an estimated 156 tons of shell during 2015, an 18% increase in shells collected from 2014. We gardened oysters with the assistance of over 30 volunteers who deployed 0.71 cubic yards of recycled oyster shell, 10% of which contained spat, on existing reefs in Kemah and San Leon. We also created over 230 feet of oyster bar breakwaters along Sweetwater Lake, utilizing approximately 44 tons of oyster shell from the recycling program and assistance from 360 volunteers during 12 volunteer workdays. We also hosted numerous community-based habitat enhancement events including TPWDs annual Abandoned Crab Trap Removal event at the Fort Anahuac Park site, in which we removed 147 crab traps from Trinity Bay with the assistance of 50 volunteers and 6 boats; a River, Lakes, Bays,N Bayous Trash Bash event at Bay Area Park, in which 803 volunteers collected an estimated 3.4 tons of trash, recyclables, and compostable materials as well as 53 tires from the Armand Bayou watershed; and Marsh Mania marsh grass planning events in the spring and fall, in which 255 volunteers planted 1.3 acres of estuarine intertidal marsh. We also coordinated a trash cleanup along a half-mile section of shoreline at Morgans Point with the Port of Houston Authority, Audubon Texas, and approximately 40 community volunteers in response to public concern for the littered beach, and planted 133 trees at locations including Exploration Green in Harris County, Sweetwater Nature Preserve in Galveston County, and Turtle Bayou Nature Preserve in Chambers County.##GBFs education programs allowed us to reach thousands of youth and adults in 2015, with events and campaigns aimed at increasing the publics awareness of the importance of Galveston Bay as well as more structured programs that provide science-based environmental education focused on Galveston Bay. We hosted the ninth annual Bike Around the Bay sponsored by Shell, which allowed us to bring our message to more than 1,150 registered cyclists and over 300 volunteers and expose them to the beauty of the Bay. We also hosted the Bay Day Festival at the Kemah Boardwalk, with 30 educational exhibits, support from 50 volunteers, and an estimated attendance of over 5,000 visitors. We concluded the 2014-15 Get Hip to Habitat year by serving 1,949 students at 22 schools and kicked off the 2015-16 school year with participation by 19 schools. We delivered Bay Ambassador presentations to 2,746 students and professional development training workshops and resources to 24 educators. We launched the Cease the Grease campaign with over 15 participating partners, including four campaign videos, a new website featuring a cooking oil recycling map and proper disposal methods for fats, oils, and grease, and educational handouts and games, which altogether made over 389,000 impressions.##GBFs advocacy program attempts to balance the multiple uses of Galveston Bay so that the long-term interests of the Bay itself are not compromised. In 2015, in partnership with the Houston Advanced Research Center, GBF released the inaugural Galveston Bay Report Card, with the Bay earning an overall grade of C, and began spreading the message on how the Galveston Bay community can work to improve this grade. We created and debuted the Galveston Bay Action Network pollution reporting tool that allows the public to report incidences of pollution around the Bay and automatically forwards those reports to one of nine authorities in charge of response/enforcement. In its first year, we received 39 pollution reports and reached 47,296 people on social media. We offered nine Rain Barrel Workshops with a total audience of 358 people who received 423 rain barrels and kits, potentially reducing 468,750 gallons of stormwater runoff from reaching Galveston Bay and improving water conservation in seven different cities within our watershed. Our volunteer Wetland Permit Review Committeeactive for a consecutive 26 yearsreviewed 42 applications for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permits and provided letters of concern or comments on 17 of them. GBF also completed the first draft of the application to designate Galveston Bay as a No Discharge Zone.","The mission of the Galveston Bay Foundation is to preserve, protect, and enhance the natural resources of the Galveston Bay estuarine system and its tributaries for present users and for posterity.",2.02E+17,14263984,990,4/7/2017 16:17,GALVESTON BAY FOUNDATION INC,201512,2017,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conservancy staff maintain and clean the Parks grounds including water areas and hardscapes. Conservancy gardeners plant and water trees and weed flower beds. All maintenance of the 15-acre McGovern Centennial Gardens and landscaped parking lot is done by Conservancy staff. Nine full-time employees manage and maintain the gardens. The McGovern Centennial Gardens rental venues, the Cherie Flores Garden Pavilion and the Celebration Garden are staffed by a full-time manager and two part-time event coordinators as well as several maintenance staff. In addition, thousands of hours are contributed by dedicated Conservancy volunteers in the McGovern Centennial Gardens, the Japanese Garden, and throughout the Park. Volunteers are involved in Park maintenance, horticulture and reforestation in the Japanese Garden and assisting with annual Park events.##Planning, Design and Construction The Conservancy identified underdeveloped areas of the Park that could be developed into more visitor-friendly landscapes and brought prominent landscape architecture firm, Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, onboard to study the Parks needs and develop an updated master plan to guide improvements for the next 20 years. The Grand Gateway renovation was completed in 2016. In addition to funds raised by the Centennial Campaign, the $5 million projects funding included nearly $3 million from a grant awarded through the Texas Department of Transportation, which managed the project with the Conservancy and the City of Houston. The project improved connectivity to nearby neighborhoods, added irrigation for the live oaks lining Main Street, and updated the Parks historic main entrance with colorful seasonal plantings. The Conservancy and the City of Houston collaborated on a restoration project in the Japanese Garden ahead of the gardens 25th anniversary in 2017. The restoration project included structural improvements as well as a new dry-stream garden. Architecture firm Curtis & Windham moved forward with the next phase of restoration of Hermann Parks historic clubhouse, built in 1933. By the end of fiscal year, the Conservancy had secured nearly $3.3 million toward its $5.8 million goal.##Visitor ServicesThe Visitor Services department was developed in 2008 when Hermann Park Conservancy was awarded the contract by the City of Houston to manage the Hermann Park Railroad. Visitor Services oversees and operates the train, pedal boats, and Pinewood Cafe and coordinates activities with the Conservancy Gift Shop and food vendors throughout the Park. The department hosts special programs at Lake Plaza including a yearly birthday party for Park namesake, George Hermann, the holiday train, a festive holiday party with arts and crafts and other activities, holiday brunches at Pinewood Cafe, and student performances. Approximately 40 staff members are responsible for creating an exciting and memorable experience for Park visitors and keeping Lake Plaza operating efficiently and safely. The maintenance team is responsible for the cleaning and upkeep of Lake Plaza.",Hermann Park Conservancy is a citizens' organization dedicated to the stewardship and improvement of Hermann Park - today and for generations to come.,2.02E+17,14573023,990,7/18/2017 23:11,HERMANN PARK CONSERVANCY,201606,2017,2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As part of ASE's general outreach efforts, our astronaut and cosmonaut members visit schools, universities and youth groups world-wide and interact with thousands of teachers, parents and students each year. ASE continuously explores creative ways to engage and inspire the next generation of scientists, astronauts and engineers.In 2016, ASE-USA continued its partnership with Ardusat, Inc. and Northrop Grumman Corporation to provide exciting and unique opportunities for high-school aged teams to conduct their own real research experiment in Earth orbit on board a real satellite. Participants engage with focused online course content, and will design and build their own programs to monitor any of the 20 sensors onboard, using a variety of real-time, online resources. This unique program is intended to drive students toward STEM education and careers and to give them hands on, project-based learning experience in multiple formats - in the classroom, through independent study, or via science clubs and other after-school activities. ASE-USA spent $13,500 to support thirty-four teams from across the USA, who were selected to prepare and fly space experiments. Many of the teams tested their experiments on a balloon launch that went to 100,000 feet and several have completed their space experiments.ASE-USA also awarded scholarships at George Mason University and at Washington State University.At each Planetary Congress, ASE members dedicate a full day for outreach with the local and national communities in the country where the Congress is being hosted. The astronauts and cosmonauts reach thousands of students, teachers, parents, and members of the general public to inspire and promote education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. ASE-USA member astronauts also engage with students and teachers throughout the year in the USA with school and university visits and lectures, as well as via partnerships with other educational organizations.##Planetary Congress of ASE and International Space Exploration communication and support: Since 1985, ASE has convened an annual Planetary Congress to serve as a forum where members interact professionally and develop ASE programs. Members exchange information about their national space programs, make technical presentations on selected topics relevant to human space flight operations.Ninety-two astronauts and cosmonauts from nineteen nations convened September 20-27, 2015 for the XXVIII Planetary Congress. Delegates participated in workshops and in educational outreach to local schools and the general public. ASE also participated and sponsored regional meetings, summits and reunions all over the world. These meetings and conferences provide members the opportunity to share information and promote the mission of ASE##Earth Stewardship. ASE provides members opportunities to communicate their unique perspective of Earth to help stimulate humanity's sense of responsibility for the future of our planet. ASE considers it important to provide its members with opportunities to communicate their unique perspective of Earth to help stimulate humanity's sense of responsibility for the future of our planet. Among ASE's premier activities in the area of environmental education have been the publication of the international best-seller The Home Planet in hard and soft cover, partnership in the development and deployment of the on-orbit astronaut earth photography tool Windows on Earth, participation in the United Nations Earth Day and Mission to Planet Earth ceremonies and sponsorship of environmental films and videos.","The Association of Space Explorers (ASE) serves as a professional forum for its members to promote the exchange of space flight experiences and technical information concerning space operations, science, development, testing and training.

Each year, CEE's benchmark programs provide materials and training for more than 35,000 educators, who reach millions of young people with essential information about conservation and the environment. See below for a description of each of CEE's educational programs.Project WILD is a supplementary, interdisciplinary, instructional program for educators of students in kindergarten through high school that is balanced and fair, neither pro nor con on value-sensitive issues. Project WILD's mission is to provide wildlife-based conservation and environmental education that fosters responsible actions toward wildlife and related natural resources. The goal of Project WILD is to assist learners of any age in developing awareness, knowledge, skills and commitment to result in informed decisions, responsible behavior and constructive actions concerning wildlife and the environment upon which all life depends.The Flying WILD program engages middle schools in bird education efforts with the intent of encouraging increased environmental stewardship among youth. Special emphasis is placed on creating an approach that is readily adaptable for urban schools, often with underserved students who traditionally receive few opportunities to participate in environmental education initiatives.Growing Up WILD is an early childhood education program that builds on childrens sense of wonder about nature and invites them to explore wildlife and the world around them. Through a wide range of activities and experiences, Growing Up WILD provides an early foundation for developing positive impressions about the natural world and lifelong social and academic skills.WET in the City engages K-12 youth in hands-on activities that creatively explore the science of water, its cultural context, and complex issues surrounding its management and stewardship.

Owned by LCRA, the five-acre riverside grounds feature exhibits that teach the history and importance of the Texas Colorado River. Interactive water features reveal how flooding and water supply is managed by the Highland Lakes and dams system. Rainwater harvesting and storm water management systems demonstrate how water can be conserved and protected. The grounds are open to the public free of charge. Youth programming provided by the Colorado River Alliance includes grounds exploration and volunteer-led activities.##Colorado River Tours: The Colorado River Tour is a semi-annual, invitation-only series which aims to inform and elevate the dialog about the Colorado River and Texas water resources among regional leaders. Tour attendees represent state and regional leadership, water planning experts, water managers, and community stakeholders. Attendees participate in a two day, bus tour through the Colorado River basin, focused on Texas' complex water issues, including learning about water use, management policy issues, and challenges facing water resources.##Texas Colorado River Mobile Learning Experience: Launched in April 2015, the Texas Colorado River Mobile Learning Experience will bring a high-quality STEM field-trip experience to our schools, inspiring the next generation of Texas water stewards. Housed in a 40-foot trailer, this project will bring a museum-quality learning experience to Central Texas schools. Students will enter a watery world where science and technology merge to encourage critical thinking about our most precious resource. Interactive models will engage and instruct, inspiring students to go out and make a difference.","The Mission of the Colorado River Alliance is to mobilize financial and human resources to promote educational awareness, appreciation and stewardship of the Texas Colorado River as a sustainable resource for the quality of life and economic well-being for future generations.",2.02E+17,14626587,990,8/9/2017 14:24,FRIENDS OF THE COLORADO RIVER FOUNDATION,201606,2017,2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, over 900 acres are actively managed within our preserve boundaries. Critical prairie habitat is annually being restored and then preserved through controlled burns and mowing to reduce invasive species and replanting native grasses and forbs propagated in our native plant nursery. More recently, ABNC has assumed management of a 24-acre tract that specifically protects the endangered Prairie Dawn Flower species. Additionally, ABNC manages over 330 acres of Texas State Coastal Preserve in the Armand Bayou watershed, restoring intertidal marsh to maintain appropriate water depth and encourage native plant and animal recolonization.##Education: Over 9,500 students of all ages participate in ABNC environmental education programs annually. School groups attend Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) correlated outdoor classes, field trips, and unique natural and cultural history programs. ABNC offers outdoor nature camps each summer and winter, scouting and similar youth programs, and community outreaches. ABNC has also introduced a range of early-childhood outdoor programs and STEM focused classes to support home school programs.##Visitor Services: Over 20,000 guests visit ABNC annually, another 2,000 member visits are also recorded. Almost 2,500 people travel to ABNC to attend meetings and private events each year. Visitors follow the self-guided accessible Discovery Trail interpretive loop to habitat overlooks, interpretive exhibits and historical farm displays; others venture out on over 5 miles of developed hiking trails. Volunteers help ABNC conduct numerous interpretive activities, including guided trail hikes, animal demonstrations, hands-on-history craft demonstrations, and guided canoe and pontoon boat tours of Armand Bayou.

See below for a description of each of CEE's educational programs.Project WILD is a supplementary, interdisciplinary, instructional program for educators of students in kindergarten through high school that is balanced and fair, neither pro nor con on value-sensitive issues. Project WILD's mission is to provide wildlife-based conservation and environmental education that fosters responsible actions toward wildlife and related natural resources. The goal of Project WILD is to assist learners of any age in developing awareness, knowledge, skills and commitment to result in informed decisions, responsible behavior and constructive actions concerning wildlife and the environment upon which all life depends.The Flying WILD program engages middle schools in bird education efforts with the intent of encouraging increased environmental stewardship among youth. Special emphasis is placed on creating an approach that is readily adaptable for urban schools, often with underserved students who traditionally receive few opportunities to participate in environmental education initiatives.Growing Up WILD is an early childhood education program that builds on childrens sense of wonder about nature and invites them to explore wildlife and the world around them.

TALT staff provides professional, efficient, responsive and experienced service for the negotiations of conservation easements. TALT will then monitor and steward these easements on an annual basis. TALT's processes have been developed over the past ten years and incorporate best management practices from the Land Trust Alliance (LTA) and from members of the Partnership of Rangeland Trusts (PORT). At the end of the tax year, TALT held conservation easements on nearly 226,000 acres of Texas farms and ranches throughout the state. TALT today is the largest state-based land trust in Texas and numbers among in the top 15 regional or state wide land trusts in the country according to a recent LTA census.##Outreach on public benefit of conservation easements of private, working lands: TALT's outreach work falls into two categories: to educate landowners and their advisors on how to use conservation easements to protect, conserve and pass land down to future generations; and to communicate the need to protect agricultural lands and open space, and the many benefits - such as clean and plentiful drinking water, domestic and affordable food and fiber, and wildlife habitat - that these lands provide to all Texans. Our education and outreach programs occur in a wide variety of formats and reach diverse audiences. During the tax year, TALT's outreach efforts included: landowner workshops in Corpus, Brazoria and Victoria; sponsorship and attendance of Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Ranch Gatherings across the state; presentations to the Wildlife Committee of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, Natural Resource Conservation Services State Technical Advisory Committee, TPWD district staff, Texas Chapter of The Wildlife Society, financial planners, CPAs and attorneys in McAllen, and South Texas Property Rights Association; attendance and participation at Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers annual convention, Texas Wildlife Association annual convention, Trans-Pecos Wildlife Conference, Texas Land and Mineral Owners Association, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Institute, Texas Coalition for Conservation and the Fort Worth Livestock Show and Rodeo. TALT aslo continued the ""No Land No Water campaign to successfully garner funding support for the Texas Farms and Ranch Land Conservation Program through legislative action. Through the use of its newsletter, social media and speaking engagements, TALT educates an urban audience regarding the public benefits of rural working lands.","The mission of the Texas Agricultural Land Trust (TALT) is to conserve the Texas heritage of agricultural lands, natural resources and wildlife habitats. TALT works to sustain the long-term stewardship of private lands for the benefit of all Texans. TALT accomplishes its mission through the use of voluntary conservation measures and through education and outreach efforts. TALT partners with private landowners to negotiate and transact conservation easements that protect important conservation values, in accordance with IRC Section 170(h). These privately stewarded lands provide public benefits such as productive agricultural lands, scenic views, drinking water protection, natural wildlife habitat and open space. Additionally, with a state that holds 94% privately owned lands, TALT works to educate the public on the many public benefits provided by the stewardship of private lands, and to educate Texas landowners about the use of conservation easements.

9.34933E+13,760377029,EFILE,,,,,"OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 4: Public Policy and Stewardship - KPC works with various governmental entities to track and monitor public policy that may affect KPC's lands, including major thoroughfare and road plans, flood control initiatives, and conservation easement tax incentives. KPC also monitors its conservation easement lands on an annual basis to ensure that the goals and objectives of the legal agreement between KPC and the impacted landowner are followed and the land in question remains viable for its conservation values. KPC is working to establish more vigorous baseline data on all its preserves and to tract changes over time through regular monitoring protocols.Land Management and Restoration - During 2004-2005, KPC's Board of Directors approved securing a majority ownership of the historic Warren Ranch, a working cattle ranch. The Board determined that the continued operations of the Warren Ranch were part of KPC's mission to protect the unique scenic, historic and natural sites on the Katy Prairie. They noted that well-managed farmland shelters wildlife, supplies scenic open space, and helps filter impurities from our air and water and that these agricultural lands offer many other benefits as well: preservation of open space and natural resources; outdoor recreation, including bird watching, hiking, hunting, and nature tours; improved flood protection; economic development through eco-tourism; enhanced wildlife habitat; recharge zones for the area's aquifers; educational field trips for area youth, and research opportunities for colleges and universities in ecology and land management. The prairie also provides children who might not otherwise have an opportunity to visit a working ranch to ride a horse or tour a farm to see how food is produced - a distinctive outdoor experience.","Long-term goals are to: protect 50,000 acres; allow public access; ensure responsible stewardship of protected lands; restore and enhance wildlife habitat; offer educational programs; and conduct and facilitate appropriate research to accomplish KPCs mission.","Land Conservation - The Katy Prairie Conservancy (KPC) protects land on the Katy Prairie in the following ways: acquisition of conservation lands at fair market value, acquisition of conservation lands through a bargain sale arrangement, receipt of donated conservation lands to KPC, receipt of donated trade lands to KPC, donation of conservation easements to KPC, and purchase of development rights on conservation lands on the Katy Prairie. Conservation lands are held in permanent trust and are maintained for the benefit of both the wildlife that inhabit the lands and the public who enjoy visiting KPC's preserves.##Preserve Enhancement - KPC has developed general management plans for all its protected properties that ensure that the lands are not further degraded by invasive species (including Chinese Tallow, McCartney Rose, feral hogs and other feral animals) and are maintained in their traditional uses. More detailed management plans are prepared for properties as KPC undertakes preserve enhancement and restoration activities, including the restoration and creation of wetlands and the enhancement and replanting of native grasslands.##Community Education and Outreach - KPC offered more than 100 events, tours, and programs to enable the public to enjoy different aspects of the Katy Prairie, including its bi-monthly Unplugged Adventures (special activities at KPC's preserves), guided tours, and training for current and prospective volunteers. In addition KPC also hosts small group tours (working in cooperation with other conservation entities and area naturalists) as well as field trips for young people. Interpretive signs and field guides enhance the visitor experience and expanded outreach and marketing efforts through KPC's website and use of electronic newsletter reached broader audiences. KPC also has developed programming at area schools and parks to make people more aware of the importance of prairies to the region.","Katy Prairie Conservancy (KPC) is dedicated to protecting a sustainable portion of the Katy Prairie for the benefit of its wildlife and the enjoyment of all Texans.

As part of ASE's general outreach efforts, our astronaut and cosmonaut members visit schools, universities and youth groups world-wide and interact with thousands of teachers, parents and students each year. ASE continuously explores creative ways to engage and inspire the next generation of scientists, astronauts and engineers.In 2016, ASE-USA continued its partnership with Ardusat, Inc. and Northrop Grumman Corporation to provide exciting and unique opportunities for high-school aged teams to conduct their own real research experiment in Earth orbit on board a real satellite. Participants engage with focused online course content, and design and build their own programs to monitor any of the 20 sensors onboard, using a variety of real-time, online resources. This unique program is intended to drive students toward Science/Technology/Engineering/Math (STEM) education and careers and to give them hands on, project-based learning experience in multiple formats - in the classroom, through independent study, or via science clubs and other after-school activities. ASE-USA spent $15,300 to support teams from across the USA, who were selected to prepare and fly space experiments. At each Planetary Congress, ASE members dedicate a full day for outreach with the local and national communities in the country where the Congress is being hosted. The astronauts and cosmonauts reach thousands of students, teachers, parents, and members of the general public to inspire and promote education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. ASE-USA member astronauts also engage with students and teachers throughout the year in the USA with school and university visits and lectures, as well as via partnerships with other educational organizations.##Planet Stewardship. ASE provides members opportunities to communicate their unique perspective of Earth to help stimulate humanity's sense of responsibility for the future of our planet. Among ASE's premier activities in the area of environmental education is the partnership in the development and deployment of the on-orbit astronaut earth photography tool Windows on Earth.

Since 2010, we have delivered 4,174,209 branded bottles of water with words of inspiration and encouragement inscribed on them, such as Hope, Love, Peace and Dream, throughout Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Arkansas. All bottles are rPet bottles that are 100% recyclable.##I Am Jobs by I Am Waters: A study was conducted in 2016, ""When Water Meets a Higher Need: A Study of an Unprecedented Mission,"" in order to assess the impact and efficacy of IAW's program. The water and the word are invitations to initiate a conversation within themselves to begin the process of reintegration into society and improve their quality of life. When a person is ready, job placement becomes a crucial step to ending homelessness and beginning self-sufficiency. There is a hot-line for the homeless to call when they are ready to work. IAW staff then assesses the individual and enters them in the Airtable database and assists the candidate with a resume if needed. IAW staff is developing corporate relationships for job opportunities for the candidates. The I Am Jobs program also includes mentoring through the process of obtaining and keeping a job. The goal is for the candidate to gain meaningful employment for at least a year and then be a mentor in the program themselves.##Face of the American Homeless (Image Campaign): The Face of the American Homeless program has been established to bring a face to who the American homeless are. I Am Waters discovered that a highly productive and meaningful way to engage with the homeless community and create a dialogue was to organize a photo-shoot at the various shelters. With the help of a professional photographer, we captured the images of dozens of homeless and used these images as a way to talk with them about their current situation.

Several programs utilize trained citizen scientists to augment professional monitoring data and aid in watershed planning. In 2016, GBFs Volunteer Water Monitoring Team was represented (at year-end) by 57 volunteers who sampled from 59 sites. GBF continued to contribute our water quality data to the Citizen Science Data Portal, a part of the Gulf of Mexico Coastal Ocean Observing System (GCOOS). We also trained 15 citizen monitors for the new Bottlenose Dolphin Field Research Assistant program and utilized their services on seven boat-based dolphin surveys in Upper Galveston Bay conducted by program partner, Environmental Institute of Houston. GBF continued to be actively engaged in discussion and planning on improving coastal resiliency and to advocate for the allocation of research dollars to the region to ensure the health of Galveston Bay and its users.",The Galveston Bay Foundation works to ensure a clean and healthy Galveston Bay that can be enjoyed by people today and for generations to come. Our diverse programs preserve and protect Texas largest and most productive estuary.,"GBFs conservation programs focus on estuarine habitat preservation, protection, and restoration. Continuing our work as a nationally accredited land trust, GBF acquired over 140 acres of new fee simple conservation properties in 2016, including 102 acres along Chocolate Bayou in Brazoria County, 8.55 acres adjacent to our Sweetwater Nature Preserve in Galveston County, and 29.96 acres in Kemah in Galveston County that will be restored as a habitat demonstration area and opened to the public as part of the future Galveston Bay Education Center and headquarters for GBF. We also acquired a conservation easement on a 216-acre Coastal Heritage Preserve tract in Galveston County and hosted the Grand Opening and Ribbon Cutting Ceremony at another property on which we hold a conservation easement, the Turtle Bayou Nature Preserve in Chambers County. GBF also worked extensively in 2016 to restore degraded habitats around Galveston Bay. We coordinated the restoration of 70 acres of intertidal marsh by partnering with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Natural Resources Damage Assessment Trustees to beneficially use material dredged from the GIWW to restore wetland habitat; constructed and planted 33 marsh mounds as part of phase 2 of the Burnet Bay Wetlands Restoration project; completed two living shorelines projects with private landowners and hosted a living shorelines workshop for contractors, agency partners, and homeowners; planted 132 trees at locations including Rich Sanctuary and Turtle Bayou Nature Preserve in Chambers County and Sweetwater Preserve in Galveston County; and planted one acre of intertidal marsh at the Shipe Woods project site and 1.5 acres at the Oyster Lake project site. We welcomed a new restaurantTookies Seafoodto our Galveston Bay Oyster Shell Recycling Program and continued collecting shells from Tommys Restaurant and Oyster Bar, Topwater Grill, the Kemah Boardwalk, Crazy Alans Swamp Shack, and Captain Bennys Seafood, reclaiming 168 tons of shells, a 28% increase from the previous year. Utilizing some of this reclaimed oyster shell, we constructed approximately 200 feet of oyster bars within Sweetwater Lake with assistance from 128 volunteers during eight volunteer workdays and gardened oysters with the assistance of over 60 volunteers who deployed 7,800 oyster shells, 30% of which contained newly grown spat, on existing restoration reefs in Kemah, San Leon, and Galveston. GBF also hosted numerous community-based habitat enhancement events including TPWDs annual Abandoned Crab Trap Removal event at the Fort Anahuac Park site, in which we removed 268 crab traps from Trinity Bay with the assistance of 85 volunteers and 10 boats; a River, Lakes, Bays, N Bayous Trash Bash event at Bay Area Park, in which 585 volunteers collected an estimated 1.1 tons of trash, recyclables, and compostable materials as well as 49 tires from the Armand Bayou watershed; a trash cleanup site with the Port of Houston Authority at Morgans Point as part of the Texas Adopt-A-Beach Cleanup program, in which 84 volunteers collected 1,800 pounds of trash and 1,000 pounds of recyclable materials from a 1.3-mile stretch of shoreline; and marsh grass planting events, including Marsh Mania events in the fall and spring, at Beach City, Anahuac, Dickinson, and Brazoria County involving 121 volunteers in planting 4.09 acres of estuarine intertidal marsh.##GBFs education programs allowed us to reach thousands of youth and adults in 2016, with events and campaigns aimed at increasing the publics awareness of the importance of Galveston Bay as well as more structured programs that provide science-based environmental education focused on Galveston Bay. We hosted the tenth annual Bike Around the Bay sponsored by Shell, which allowed us to bring our message to more than 1,460 registered cyclists and over 300 volunteers and expose them to the beauty of the Bay. We also hosted the Bay Day Festival at the Kemah Boardwalk, with 35 educational exhibits, support from 87 volunteers, and an estimated attendance of over 4,800 visitors. We concluded the 2015-16 Get Hip to Habitat year by serving 1,500 students at 19 schools and kicked off the 2016-17 school year with participation by 15 schools. We delivered Bay Ambassador presentations to 2,000 students and professional development training workshops and resources to 30 educators. GBF also hosted nine Rain Barrel Workshops and delivered 489 rain barrels and kits into local communities, potentially reducing 546,450 gallons of stormwater runoff from reaching Galveston Bay and improving water conservation within our watershed. We continued our outreach efforts on the Cease the Grease campaign with over 15 participating partners and established a cooking oil recycling station in partnership with the City of Nassau Bay.##GBFs advocacy program attempts to balance the multiple uses of Galveston Bay so that the long-term interests of the Bay itself are not compromised. In 2016, we engaged in dialogue with local staff of our U.S. and State representatives and senators on a variety of Galveston Bay issues including San Jacinto River Waste Pits, storm surge mitigation, seafood consumption safety, closure of Rollover Pass, and the Clean Waters Rule (Waters of the U.S.). Of critical importance, we advocated for removal of the dioxin wastes at the San Jacinto River Waste Pits in Channelview by providing official comments to EPA and educating and rallying local community members, recreational fishermen, commercial fishermen, and all eight local U.S. congressmen to support the call for removal. GBF also began meeting with local stakeholders to discuss the No Discharge Zone initiative for Galveston Bay. In partnership with the Houston Advanced Research Center, GBF released the second annual Galveston Bay Report Card in 2016, with the Bay earning an overall grade of C, and continued our efforts to spread the message on how the Galveston Bay community can work to improve this grade. Through our partnership with Texas Living Waters, we helped to launch the Texas Water Conservation Scorecard, an analysis that ranks 306 Texas water utilities according to their water conservation efforts. We also launched the Galveston Bay Water Brigade, a campaign designed to raise awareness of the effect of water conservation on environmental flows and freshwater inflows for Galveston Bay, and partnered with City of Houstons Sustainability Office to include it as part of the 2016 City of Houston Green Office Challenge. We also engaged Hispanic community leaders and citizens in water-related issues through the event Strengthening Alliances for our Regions Water Future and the newly created Facebook page ATH: Agua Para Todos Houston. GBF began development of a downloadable mobile app for the Galveston Bay Action Network pollution reporting tool that allows the public to report pollution around the Bay and automatically forwards those reports to one of eleven authorities in charge of response/enforcement. Our volunteer Wetland Permit Review Committeeactive for a consecutive 27 yearsreviewed 28 applications for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permits and provided letters of concern or comments on 7 of them.","The mission of the Galveston Bay Foundation is to preserve, protect, and enhance the natural resources of the Galveston Bay estuarine system and its tributaries for present users and for posterity.",2.02E+17,15207071,990,3/7/2018 20:31,GALVESTON BAY FOUNDATION INC,201612,2018,2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Responsibilities include maintaining and cleaning the Parks grounds, water features, and hardscapes; planting and watering trees; and weeding. The Conservancy manages the maintenance program for the 15-acre McGovern Centennial Gardens. Conservancy maintenance workers keep the gardens in top condition, ensuring that the gardens are well tended through each season. The Cherie Flores Garden Pavilion and Celebration Garden, McGovern Centennial Gardens rental venues, are available to host private events in an elegant urban garden setting. The volunteer program supports the McGovern Centennial Gardens staff as well as lending a hand throughout the Park. Volunteers are involved with Park maintenance, horticulture and reforestation efforts and create a connection between the Park and the community.##Visitor ServicesThe Visitor Services department was developed in 2008 when Hermann Park Conservancy was awarded the contract by the City of Houston to manage the Hermann Park Railroad. Visitor Services oversees and operates the train, pedal boats, and Pinewood Cafe, and coordinates activities with the Conservancy Gift Shop and food vendors throughout the Park. The department hosts special programs at Lake Plaza including a yearly birthday party for Park namesake, George Hermann, the holiday train, a festive holiday party with arts and crafts and other activities, holiday brunches at Pinewood Cafe and student performances. Approximately 40 staff members are responsible for creating an exciting and memorable experience for Park visitors and keeping Lake Plaza operating efficiently and safely. The maintenance team is responsible for the cleaning and upkeep of Lake Plaza.##Planning, Design and Construction The Conservancy identified underdeveloped areas of the Park that could be developed into more visitor-friendly landscapes and brought prominent landscape architecture firm, Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, on board to study the Park's needs and develop an updated master plan to guide improvements for the next 20 years. The Conservancy and the City of Houston collaborated on a restoration project in the Japanese Garden ahead of the garden's 25th anniversary in 2017.

To meet the demands of this new management agreement, the Conservancy incurred large start-up costs to purchase equipment, materials, and supplies and to nearly double staff and contractors. Park management software was purchased to improve staff efficiency, customer service and to track productivity; a new cloud based document retention system and an electronic timekeeping system were part of additional technological improvements. Special projects included resurfacing trails, updating signage, maps, and entrances throughout the Park, repairing damage after two unusual flood events, increasing mowing from every 21 days to every 7-14 days, daily clearing and de-littering of ADA ramps and high-use parking lots, and daily restroom and sanitation services. The Conservancy also has arobust internship and research program for studying the diverse aspects of managing, improving and maintaining a forested urban park. In addition to this work, more than 3,000 volunteer hours were contributed toward the rehabilitation and beautification of the Park, all while working alongside professional staff and vocational horticulturists such as Master Naturalists and Master Gardeners.##See Schedule OEcological Restoration: This year's ecological restoration and conservation program included convening an Eco-Tech panel of area experts that met frequently throughout the year to address and find solutions for ecological issues within the Park. The Conservancy treated approximately 190 acres for invasive species to prepare for the ecological restoration projects identified in the Memorial Park Master Plan. Two thousand trees were planted as part of ecological restoration work for the Eastern Glades project in partnership with Trees for Houston. The Conservancy finalized an in-depth tree inventory to build on existing landscaped areas inventory and provided habitat assessment in select locations. In conjunction with this, a biological assessment was initiated to identify and inventory all living creatures in the Park (insects, animals, and plants). As part of an ongoing fuels management program, over 140 acres were treated for hazardous fuels reduction including the removal of 900 hazard trees. Over 1,000 stumps were ground as part of ongoing park care. A native meadow grass demonstration garden was installed to inform the success of future projects. In addition to ecological care of the natural environment, sensitive maintenance was the focus of the Conservancy's volunteer and community outreach program.##See Schedule OCapital Improvements: The Conservancy, in partnership with the Uptown Houston Tax Reinvestment Zone #17, implemented capital improvements as part of the Master Plan. All Master Plan Phase 1 projects were developed through conceptual design. The first Master Plan project, the Eastern Glades, broke ground. Project planning and design work progressed including archeological studies for Memorial Groves; preparation of construction drawings for Phase 1 of Eastern Glades; and schematic design work for the Park's Hogg Bird Sanctuary led by partnering organization Houston Parks Board. MPC supported the installation of a 12"" water line and the final phase of resurfacing the popular exercise trail in the Park. As part of advancing future capital improvements to the Park, a capital campaign was launched and raised over $10M in pledges at the end of the fiscal year.","Memorial Park Conservancy (MPC) is dedicated to the preservation and enhancement of Memorial Park for today and for future generations; to public use, enjoyment and education in accordance with conditions of the conveyance to the City of Houston.",2.02E+17,15289578,990,5/4/2018 21:43,MEMORIAL PARK CONSERVANCY INC,201705,2018,2017,5,7575 N PICNIC,26290646,1939810,core2014pc,HOUSTON,201505,1518538,,Y,48201,,15,10,,9373467,,PC,S,ZA,C,C,3362,813219,MEMORIAL PARK CONSERVANCY INC,C,C113,,C1130,,EN,EN,OT,IN,,,3360,0.112054268,200010,,,TX,3,201705,2018,N,77007,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sanctuaries are managed with a focus on habitat restoration, invasive species control, bird monitoring and protection, and providing public access to inspiring natural experiences. Last year the HAS Natives Nursery was upgraded to increase the plant-growing capacity for local bird-friendly community-based projects and for regional partners working to increase pollinator habitats. In 2016 HAS applied for and subsequently was awarded accreditation under the national program for land trusts, demonstrating its commitment to quality standards for protecting natural places and a sound program of land stewardship.##EDUCATION & OUTREACH: Last year HAS provided 979 unique natural science programs to over 47,000 children and adults at its two urban nature centers and through its extensive programming throughout the Houston-Galveston area. Program offerings include nature camps, outreach programs to schools and community groups, onsite workshops and tours, naturalist-led field trips, and citizen science bird surveys and watch events. HAS also sponsors regular speaker programs, publishes a bi-monthly newsletter, and hosts an informative website covering topics of interest to birders and nature enthusiasts. In 2016 the HAS website was redesigned to better accommodate mobile platforms and to incorporate a Bird Friendly Houston component, with the goal of transforming Houston into a city that celebrates birds and values natural spaces.",The vision of Houston Audubon Society (HAS) is a healthier natural environment and a more beautiful place to live created by leading and nurturing a community that values and supports birds.,2.02E+17,15646269,990,8/31/2018 18:23,HOUSTON AUDUBON SOCIETY INC,201706,2018,2017,6,440 WILCHESTER BLVD,7745221,7095240,16eofinextract990.dat,HOUSTON,201506,1370346,,Y,48201,,16,10,,1920590,,PC,O,EN,C,C,3362,813312,HOUSTON AUDUBON SOCIETY,C,C30,,C30,,EN,EN,OT,IN,,,3360,0.480284156,197001,,,TX,3,201706,2018,N,77079,,,,,,,,,,,,

OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 8: Hike and Bike Trails - A top priority of Buffalo Bayou Partnership is to build a continuous system of trails on the north and south banks of Buffalo Bayou from Shepherd Drive to the Turning Basin. This will give Houstonians and visitors 20 miles of trails to run, walk and bike along our waterway. To accommodate residents and visitors who want to enjoy a walk or jog along the Shepherd Drive to Sabine Street stretch of the bayou, BBP added asphalt footpaths closer to the waterway.","Buffalo Bayou Partnership (""BBP"") is transforming and revitalizing Buffalo Bayou, Houstons most significant natural resource.

The project involved flood management, eco-restoration, new hike and bike trails and an array of park amenities. The park improvements were substantially completed for the Buffalo Bayou Park project in 2015, and BBP transferred ownership to the City. BBP maintains and operates the 160-acre Buffalo Bayou Park and is also responsible for maintaining the hike and bike trails and green spaces along the waterway from Sabine to Fannin streets. To assist with ongoing maintenance and conservation efforts, BBP relies on thousands of volunteers and community service workers each year that remove weeds and invasive species, plant wildflowers, pick up trash and remove silt from the trails after heavy rains.##Buffalo Bayou Partnership Special Events - BBP offers a wide-range of recreational and cultural activities, including:Buffalo Bayou Partnership Regatta - Annual 15-mile canoe and kayak race on Buffalo Bayou from Voss Road to Sesquicentennial Park in Downtown Houston, held in March.Kids Day - A free event filled with family fun, educational activities, music, food, dazzling park performers, and bayou boat rides, held annually in October.

Currently, over 900 acres are actively managed within our preserve boundaries. Critical prairie habitat is annually being restored and then preserved through controlled burns and mowing to reduce invasive species and replanting native grasses and forbs propagated in our native plant nursery. More recently, ABNC has assumed management of a 24-acre tract that specifically protects the endangered Prairie Dawn Flower species. Additionally, ABNC manages over 330 acres of Texas State Coastal Preserve in the Armand Bayou watershed, restoring intertidal marsh to maintain appropriate water depth and encourage native plant and animal recolonization.##Education: Over 9,500 students of all ages participate in ABNC environmental education programs annually. School groups attend Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) correlated outdoor classes, field trips, and unique natural and cultural history programs. ABNC offers outdoor nature camps each summer and winter, scouting and similar youth programs, and community outreaches. ABNC has also introduced a range of early-childhood outdoor programs and STEM focused classes to support home school programs.##Visitor Services: Over 20,000 guests visit ABNC annually, another 2,000 member visits are also recorded. Almost 2,500 people travel to ABNC to attend meetings and private events each year. Visitors follow the self-guided accessible Discovery Trail interpretive loop to habitat overlooks, interpretive exhibits and historical farm displays; others venture out on over 5 miles of developed hiking trails. Volunteers help ABNC conduct numerous interpretive activities, including guided trail hikes, animal demonstrations, hands-on-history craft demonstrations, and guided canoe and pontoon boat tours of Armand Bayou. ABNC special places are also available for family retreats, company meetings and seasonal parties. Several community groups utilize ABNC meeting spaces, and ABNC regularly hosts nature-related conferences.",To preserve the habitats with which we have been entrusted and to provide opportunities for people to experience and understand the local ecosystems.

REEFS WILL ATTRACT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF FISH, BUT MORE ARE ABLE TO GROW IF A SITE INCLUDES A SMALL REEF FOR SMALLER FISH, A MID-SIZED REEF FOR MID-SIZED FISH AND A LARGE REEF FOR LARGER FISH. THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY REEF UTILIZES VARIOUS MATERIALS TO CATER TO DIFFERENT SPECIES, SUCH AS CINDER BLOCKS, LARGE CONCRETE PYRAMIDS AND SUNKEN SHRIMP BOATS. A RECENT PHASE OF THE REEF WILL SEE THE DEVELOPMENT OF 60,000-240,000 RED SNAPPER PER YEAR, WITH 50 PERCENT REMAINING IN THE GULF. THIS GROWTH WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON THE LOCAL ECONOMY AND BUSINESSES. STUDIES ARE CONTINUOUSLY BEING ADMINISTERED ON EFFICIENCY AND EFFICACY OF THE GROWING REEF BY THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS RIO GRANDE VALLEY AND TEXAS A&M GALVESTON. DR. RICK KLINE OF UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS RIO GRANDE VALLEY PRESENTED A PAPER ON THE SITE'S FIRST TEST CINDER BLOCK NURSERY REEF AT THE AMERICAN FISHERIES CONFERENCE. DR. JAY ROOKER AND HIS RESEARCHERS FROM TEXAS A&M GALVESTON RECENTLY COUNTED 1,700 IMMEDIATE POST-SETTLEMENT JUVENILE RED SNAPPER ON ONE OF THE SITE'S 300 NURSERY PATCHES THAT ARE LESS THAN 30 DAYS OLD. THESE STUDIES ARE BOLSTERING FISH POPULATIONS THROUGH IMPROVED MANAGEMENT AND DATA COLLECTION. A CURRENT STUDY ON LOCAL DEMOGRAPHICS AND THOSE SERVED BY THE REEF IS CURRENTLY BEING CONDUCTED AS WELL. WIDE SUPPORT FROM THE COMMUNITY AND LOCAL UNIVERSITIES ENSURES THAT PERFORMANCE METRICS WILL CONTINUE AT THIS SITE. THE LONG-TERM VISION OF THE RGV REEF IS TO HAVE LOW RELIEF MATERIALS IN THE REEF SITE FOR THE SMALL MARINE LIFE AND FISH, AND HIGHER RELIEF MATERIALS, SUCH AS PRE-CONSTRUCTED PYRAMIDS, FOR HIGHER RELIEF HABITAT AND LARGER FISH, THUS CREATING A ""LIFE-CYCLE"" REEF.

Each program is geared toward the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills giving students hands on experience in conducting field research and applying it to school-based studies. The programs also assist teachers in using the Wetland as a demonstration model of how humans may have a positive impact on the environment. We believe this method helps students make sound environmental decisions and provides a frame of reference when choosing a science-based career path. Our programs are continually developed and improving using external review and input from teachers and researchers alike.In 2017 the JBS Wetland Center offered 30 adult programs attracting 2,744 adults.

During the tax year, some of TALT's outreach efforts included: landowner workshops in Victoria, Bay City and Austin; sponsorship and attendance at the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Ranch Gatherings across the state; hosting information booths at the Texas Wildlife Association annual convention, TSSWCB, Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Annual Conventions, Texas Chapter of The Wildlife Society annual meeting, South Texas Property Rights Association annual meeting; Trans-Pecos Wildlife Conference, and the Texas Grazing Land Coalition Workshop. In addition, TALT celebrated its 10th Anniversary in March of 2018 with a fundraising celebration in Victoria, TX. One hundred and twenty local landowners and statewide supporters attended the event to celebrate 10 years of conservation of working lands. TALTs anniversary was also commemorated through Texas Senate Proclamation 312 commending TALT for preserving the states agricultural lands.Through the use of its newsletter, social media and speaking engagements, TALT educates an urban audience regarding the public benefits of rural working lands. TALT staff and board members additionally penned several opinion editorials that were published in major Texas newspapers highlighting the values of private working lands, as they relate to current events.##Conservation easements to protect working lands: TALT partners with landowners who seek donated conservation easements, purchase of development rights, and mitigation banking conservation easements. TALT staff provides professional, efficient, responsive and experienced service for the negotiations of conservation easements. TALT will then monitor and steward these easements on an annual basis. TALT's processes have been developed over the past eleven years and incorporate best management practices from the Land Trust Alliance (LTA) and from members of the Partnership of Rangeland Trusts (PORT). At the end of the tax year, TALT held conservation easements on over 226,000 acres of Texas farms and ranches throughout the state. TALT today is the largest state-based land trust in Texas and numbers among in the top 15 regional or state wide land trusts in the country according to a recent LTA census.","The mission of the Texas Agricultural Land Trust (TALT) is to conserve the Texas heritage of agricultural lands, natural resources and wildlife habitats. TALT works to sustain the long-term stewardship of private lands for the benefit of all Texans. TALT accomplishes its mission through the use of voluntary conservation measures and through education and outreach efforts. TALT partners with private landowners to negotiate and transact conservation easements that protect important conservation values, in accordance with IRC Section 170(h). These privately stewarded lands provide public benefits such as productive agricultural lands, scenic views, drinking water protection, natural wildlife habitat and open space. Additionally, with a state that holds 94% privately owned lands, TALT works to educate the public on the many public benefits provided by the stewardship of private lands, and to educate Texas landowners about the use of conservation easements. Since 2007, TALT has helped lando",2.02E+17,15828501,990,10/24/2018 17:19,TEXAS AGRICULTURAL LAND TRUST,201803,2018,2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

9.34933E+13,760377029,EFILE,,,,,"OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 4: Public Policy and Stewardship - KPC works with various governmental entities to track and monitor public policy that may affect KPC's lands, including major thoroughfare and road plans, flood control initiatives, and conservation easement tax incentives. KPC also monitors its conservation easement lands on an annual basis to ensure that the goals and objectives of the legal agreement between KPC and the impacted landowner are followed and the land in question remains viable for its conservation values. KPC is working to establish more vigorous baseline data on all its preserves and to tract changes over time through regular monitoring protocols. OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 5: Land Management and Restoration - During 2004-2005, KPC's Board of Directors approved securing a majority ownership of the historic Warren Ranch, a working cattle ranch. The Board determined that the continued operations of the Warren Ranch were part of KPC's mission to protect the unique scenic, historic and natural sites on the Katy Prairie. They noted that well-managed farmland shelters wildlife, supplies scenic open space, and helps filter impurities from our air and water and that these agricultural lands offer many other benefits as well: preservation of open space and natural resources; outdoor recreation, including bird watching, hiking, hunting, and nature tours; improved flood protection; economic development through eco-tourism; enhanced wildlife habitat; recharge zones for the area's aquifers; educational field trips for area youth, and research opportunities for colleges and universities in ecology and land management. The prairie also provides children who might not otherwise have an opportunity to visit a working ranch to ride a horse or tour a farm to see how food is produced - a distinctive outdoor experience.","Long-term goals are to: protect 50,000 acres; allow public access; ensure responsible stewardship of protected lands; restore and enhance wildlife habitat; offer educational programs; and conduct and facilitate appropriate research to accomplish KPCs mission.","Land Conservation - The Katy Prairie Conservancy (KPC) protects land on the Katy Prairie in the following ways: acquisition of conservation lands at fair market value, acquisition of conservation lands through a bargain sale arrangement, receipt of donated conservation lands to KPC, receipt of donated trade lands to KPC, donation of conservation easements to KPC, and purchase of development rights on conservation lands on the Katy Prairie. Conservation lands are held in permanent trust and are maintained for the benefit of both the wildlife that inhabit the lands and the public who enjoy visiting KPC's preserves.##Preserve Enhancement - KPC has developed general management plans for all its protected properties that ensure that the lands are not further degraded by invasive species (including Chinese Tallow, McCartney Rose, feral hogs and other feral animals) and are maintained in their traditional uses. More detailed management plans are prepared for properties as KPC undertakes preserve enhancement and restoration activities, including the restoration and creation of wetlands and the enhancement and replanting of native grasslands.##Land Management and Restoration - During 2004-2005, KPC's Board of Directors approved securing a majority ownership of the historic Warren Ranch, a working cattle ranch.

Schools are chosen based on recommendations from parents, teachers, principals, neighbors, and administrators. Trees For Houston surveys the school grounds with the school staff to determined the number and species of trees that should be planted.After the trees are planted, Trees For Houston waters, stakes, and mulches the trees for a minimum of two years to ensure their survival. This year, the Trees for Schools program planted and maintained 1,526 trees at 48 Houston area school grounds.##The Trees For Houston Nursery program allows the organization to further lower tree and transportation costs, gives the ability to grow out more trees rather than having to purchase them on a per project basis, and ultimately helps us get more trees in the ground in areas where neighborhoods cannot afford trees.
